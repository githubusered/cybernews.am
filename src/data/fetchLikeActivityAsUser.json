Bedevyan had extensively covered sensitive topics such as the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020 and Armenia's snap elections in 2021. Though Apple did not confirm her phone had been hacked, Bedevyan took the threat seriously. As a precaution, she reached out to CyberHub-AM, who checked her phone and found evidence of Pegasus spyware dating back to 2021, around the time of the elections. Additionally, her colleague’s phone was also found to be infected."

It is known for its ability to silently infiltrate smartphones, allowing for surveillance and data extraction. The spyware first surfaced in Armenia in 2021, infecting the phones of politicians from both the government and opposition parties. However, the identity of the attackers remains unclear. Amnesty International has raised suspicions about Azerbaijan’s involvement in these attacks, pointing to its history of using digital surveillance to target activists and journalists in the region."

The biggest changes include Mail Privacy Protection, App Privacy Report, and enhanced Siri privacy. Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from learning whether an email has been opened, and hides IP addresses so senders can't link it to other online activity. App Privacy Report provides a summary of how apps use access granted to location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts over the past seven days. Siri's privacy has been enhanced with on-device speech recognition, meaning audio requests are processed without internet connection, minimizing data leak risks."
